# Flutter + NestJS Full-Stack Absence Manager

This is a **combined repository** for two separate projects I previously built:

- [`absence_manager`](https://github.com/ahmeddhus/absence_manager): A Flutter app that displays absences with filtering and pagination.
- [`absence-api-nestjs`](https://github.com/ahmeddhus/absence-api-nestjs): A NestJS API that serves absence and member data with pagination and filtering support.

I merged them into one full-stack repo to make setup and exploration easier.
