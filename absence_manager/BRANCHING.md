# Branch Naming Convention

This project follows a clear and consistent branch naming strategy based on the type of work being done:

| Prefix       | Purpose                              | Example                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `feature/`   | New feature or functionality         | `feature/pagination`               |
| `fix/`       | Bug fix                              | `fix/loading-state`                |
| `chore/`     | Setup, tooling, config, non-feature  | `chore/folder-structure`           |
| `docs/`      | Documentation only                   | `docs/architecture-and-readme`     |
| `refactor/`  | Code cleanup with no behavior change | `refactor/usecase-layer`           |
| `test/`      | Adding or updating tests             | `test/bloc-tests`                  |

> Branch names should be lowercase, use hyphens to separate words, and be as descriptive as possible.
